## NTUEE Computer Architecture 2022 Fall  

### HW1 RISC-V
- Sort Procedure 
- Salt-and-Pepper noise denoiser with median filter    
  
### HW2 verilog
- Implement an unsigned multiplier  
- Implement an unsigned divider  
- Implement SHIFT operation  
- Implement AVG operatio  
- Combine the 4 operations into single unit (ALU)

### Final Project 
- Implement a single cycle CPU
- Add multiplication/division unit (mulDiv) to CPU (HW2)
- Handle multi-cycle operations
- Get more familiar with assembly and Verilog
